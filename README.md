Binary Phase Shift Keying Modulator and Demodulator for use with redhawk using liquid-dsp library.  

Much of this code was auto generated by Redhawk using properties I specified in the xml files.  I wrote the BPSK.cpp, BPSK_Mod.cpp, and similarly named .h files.  

To use these components 
1) Install redhawk:
  -http://redhawksdr.github.io/Documentation/mainch2.html#x4-60002
2) Install liquid-dsp
  -Clone the repository at lmcadoo2/liquid-dsp
    -git clone git://github.com/lmcadoo2/liquid-dsp.git
  -Enter the directory
  -Run the following
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
3) Get the component code
  -Clone this repository
    git clone git://github.com/kylemv/bpsk.git
  -Import the project into eclipse
    -File->Import->C/C++->Existing Code as Makefile Project
    -Browse to the folder in the 'Existing Code Location' box
    -Finish
  -Build the project
    -Right click the project folder and select 'Build Project'
  -Export to the 'Target SDR'
    -Drag the project folder to 'Target SDR' in the SCA Explorer view
4) The component is now ready for use in Redhawk.  For more information on
components in Redhawk, see chapters 3 and 4 in the documentation located here:
